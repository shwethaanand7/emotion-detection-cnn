Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- based model
for facial emotion detection capable of identifying seven distinct emotions: happy,
sad, fear, disgust, surprise, neutral, and angry. The model was trained on a diverse
dataset of facial images to accurately classify emotions in real-time. Our approach
leverages the power of deep learning to create a robust and efficient system for
automatic emotion recognition, with potential applications in various fields including
human-computer interaction, psychology, and market research. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed method,
positioning it as a valuable tool for emotion analysis in both research and practical
contexts.
